Its headless form is a testament to the singular focus and determination it embodies. In place of a traditional head, two glowing, rune-etched eyes are affixed to the front of its massive, boulder-like torso. Lord Stonehelm’s body is composed of the most resilient granite, each slab and stone meticulously arranged to create a formidable and imposing figure.","Emerging from the dark depths of a black pond, Maelrift, the Abyssal Mire, is a water elemental that embodies the essence of Vacillation. Its ever-changing form is composed of murky water and an eerie, shadowy mist that seems to constantly swirl and undulate around its body. Maelrift's eyes are like two glowing orbs of deep blue, piercing through the darkness of the black pond.","Rising above the realm of Fortitude, Valtoria, the Mountain Warden, is a formidable tree elemental that stands as a living symbol of strength and endurance. Its majestic form embodies the unyielding resolve of the mountains and the adaptability of the ever-changing forest. Valtoria’s body is composed of intertwining roots, branches, and vines that shape its towering, humanoid figure. Its limbs are strong and sturdy like the trunks of ancient trees, and its body is covered in a mix of thick bark and verdant foliage. The tree elemental's eyes glow with an inner light, reflecting the untamed power of nature coursing through its being. Within the dark fantasy world, Valtoria, the Mountain Warden, guards the secrets of the wilderness, challenging any who dare to confront it. As the final boss of the Fortitude realm, the tree elemental represents both the unbreakable spirit of the mountains and the resilience of the wild, offering a formidable trial for those who seek to prove their mettle.","The Reckless Phantoms are a pack of spector soldiers who embody the spirit of recklessness. They were once brave warriors who threw caution to the wind, charging into battle with no regard for their own safety. In death, their souls were bound to the battlefield, forever cursed to relive their final, reckless moments.","The Craven Conjurer is an undead emperal wizard who epitomizes the essence of cowardice. Once a powerful and influential figure in his mortal life, this emperor relied on deceit and manipulation to maintain his power, ultimately turning to dark magic to escape the consequences of his actions.","The Gallant is a legendary general who embodies the true spirit of valor. Renowned for his bravery, strength, and unwavering loyalty, this fearless leader inspired countless soldiers and led his army to numerous victories. Even in the face of insurmountable odds, his courage never wavered, and he fought until his dying breath.","Vortex, the Vinion Overlord, embodies the theme of Obsession within the realm of Cunning. As the leader of the Vinions, Vortex commands a quartet of mighty Vinions, each armed with an array of devastating weaponry. These four elite Vinions act in unison, their movements perfectly synchronized, allowing them to execute complex and deadly strategies against their foes.","Swarmlord Vex, the Vinion Tide, represents the theme of Rash within the realm of Cunning. As the master of countless Vinions, Vex commands a seemingly endless swarm of these small, agile creatures. This massive horde moves as a single entity, engulfing everything in its path, and leaving destruction in its wake.","Shadowseer Vazrith, the Vinion Mastermind, is the embodiment of Cunning within the realm of Vinions. Vazrith is a single, massive Vinion, whose body is composed of countless smaller Vinions fused together. This formidable creature possesses the ability to spawn smaller Vinions at will, commanding them with its superior intellect and strategic genius.","Dreamweaver Isolde is a Reverie-themed Vilewhisper boss, embodying the essence of dreams, illusions, and the subconscious. She appears as a stunningly beautiful woman with flowing, silvery hair and eyes that seem to contain an entire universe within them. Her presence is both captivating and mysterious, drawing in those who find themselves lost in her gaze.","Shattercrafter is a grotesque and twisted Vilewhisper boss that appears as a fusion of shattered glass and malformed flesh. It moves with an unnerving grace, its razor-sharp edges glinting menacingly in the dim light. The creature thrives in environments where conformity and order are paramount, causing chaos and destruction in its wake.","Painbrush is a grotesque and twisted Vilewhisper boss that has been tainted by the darkest aspects of creativity. Its body resembles a humanoid figure, but its arms and hands have transformed into a myriad of nightmarish artistic tools, such as serrated brushes and blades. Its skin appears to be made of dark, ink-like substance that constantly drips and flows, creating a sense of unease and terror.","The Eye of Hubris is a grotesque, spider-like creature, a horrifying amalgamation of Visieyes and an enormous arachnid host. Its body is covered in countless glowing eyes, each exhibiting a disturbing sense of self-importance and arrogance. The creature skitters across the battlefield, using its multitude of eyes to assess its surroundings and predict its enemies' movements with unnerving precision. It spins shadowy webs to entrap its foes, and its multiple eyes fire focused beams of dark energy, striking down those who dare challenge its perceived superiority. The Eye of Hubris' overconfidence is ultimately its weakness, as it tends to underestimate its opponents, leaving openings for a well-prepared counterattack.","The Puppeteer of Fates is a sinister octopus-like creature, born from the fusion of Visieyes and a massive cephalopod host. This vilespawn possesses a multitude of tentacles, each ending in a cluster of malevolent eyes. Its eyes are known to possess the power to control the minds of the weak-willed, turning them into unwitting pawns in its malicious schemes. The Puppeteer of Fates lurks in the darkest depths, orchestrating events from the shadows and manipulating its victims like puppets on strings. Its weakness lies in its reliance on its mind-controlled minions; if they are freed from its influence, the Puppeteer of Fates becomes significantly more vulnerable and easier to defeat.","The Orb of Illumination is the epitome of Wisdom among the Visieyes vilespawn. A massive, perfect sphere composed entirely of countless glowing eyes, this formidable creature hovers ominously above the ground, emitting a captivating aura of knowledge and enlightenment. Each eye serves as a window into the vast depths of wisdom contained within the Orb, and it uses this knowledge to outwit and outmaneuver its adversaries. The Orb of Illumination projects powerful beams of blinding light from its myriad eyes, overwhelming its enemies with a relentless barrage of dazzling energy. Its weakness is its need to constantly gather information; if its enemies can find a way to obscure their actions and intentions, they can momentarily disorient the Orb, creating an opportunity to strike.","A towering figure cloaked in dark, tattered robes, wearing a crow-faced mask. Dr. Ravencroft the Ravenous wields a twisted, rune-inscribed staff that emanates a malevolent energy, infecting those who come too close with insatiable hunger and uncontrollable cravings.","A gaunt, pale figure garbed in a tattered shroud, Mortimus the Indifferent commands an army of the undead. With a wave of his bony hand, he can raise fallen soldiers to do his bidding or sap the will to fight from the living, turning them into apathetic husks.","A captivatingly beautiful and elegant vampire, Lady Serenavaine the Deceptive exudes an aura of benevolence that lures in unsuspecting victims. Her velvet voice and graceful demeanor mask her true intentions, as she drains the life force of those who fall under her spell, all the while convincing them they are receiving a gift."],"defaultDamage\n:float":["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"],"power\n: float":["500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500","500"],"health\n: float":["2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000"],"maxResource\n:float":["100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100","100"],"moveSpeed\n:float":["7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7","7"],"critical\n:float":["0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05","0.05"],"haste\n:float":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"armor\n:float":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"defaultSkills\n:List<int>":["31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203","31222204,31222201,31222202,31222203"],"iconFileName : string":["Load Stonehelm Sprite","Maelrift Sprite","Valtoria Sprite","Phantasmaraud Sprite","Timorus Arcanis Sprite","General Gallant Sprite","Vortex Sprite","Vex Sprite","Vazrith Sprite","Isolde Sprite","Fracturemancer Sprite","Painbrush Sprite","Eye of Hubris Sprite","Destinstringer Sprite","Luxspherion Sprite","Dr Ravencroft Sprite","Mortimus Sprite","Lady Serenavaine Sprite"]}},"spreadSheetName":"CharacterData","spreadSheetID":"1BNf_4jZonJqd1ocWNGQoQDKNGtS_vtVy7H5Lmr8PVt0","sheetIDList":["210782231","75529785"],"tableTypes":[0,0],"instruction":1,"error":null}
