      slab and stone meticulously arranged to create a formidable and imposing figure."

      turning them into unwitting pawns in its malicious schemes. The Puppeteer of
      Fates lurks in the darkest depths, orchestrating events from the shadows and
      manipulating its victims like puppets on strings. Its weakness lies in its

      to outwit and outmaneuver its adversaries. The Orb of Illumination projects
      powerful beams of blinding light from its myriad eyes, overwhelming its enemies
      with a relentless barrage of dazzling energy. Its weakness is its need to constantly
      gather information; if its enemies can find a way to obscure their actions
      and intentions, they can momentarily disorient the Orb, creating an opportunity
      to strike.
